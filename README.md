# Enterprise Grade Docker Image Build Pipeline GitHub Actions

In large companies, no one runs docker build by hand on a laptop.

Images move through a gated CI workflow that enforces security, compliance, and quality from the first line of the Dockerfile to the last tag in production.

This project teaches you to design and implement that workflow. You will build, scan, sign, and promote images the way real teams do it in regulated environments.
